Trivial Twitter API consumer.  This backposts to the Twitter API to
fetch a list and re-displays it in an iframe hosted here:

I use a simple 60-second local file cache to keep from going over API
limit.  I could probably do something with postMessage to pull this in
purely on the client side, but Twitter's rate limit for this particular
API is IP-addr rate-limited, and I'm worried about aggregate users
hitting the limit.
