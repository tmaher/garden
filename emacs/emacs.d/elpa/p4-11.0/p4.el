;; This package provides emacs integration with the Perforce version control
;; system, though it does *not* do so within the normal vc package.  Refer to
;; the P4 menu or view the key bindings using the C-x p prefix to discover what
;; functionality is available.
;;
;; The integration works with the command line program p4 which must be
;; configured in the p4-executable variable.  That variable is customizable and
;; its default is based upon introspection of your system.  When not found, the
;; user is prompted for a pathname.  If that fails to produce a valid pathname,
;; then Perforce commands will silently abort.

;; ______________________________________
;; WARNING:
;;
;; Be careful mixing command line and p4.el commands, depending upon how you
;; configure your system, the following might happen:
;;
;;    % p4 edit foo.c
;;     ... Make changes to foo.c in emacs
;;    % p4 submit
;;     ... Keep the writable copy of foo.c in emacs.
;;     ... Start making changes to it.
;;     ... Discover that you can't save it.
;;     ... If you invoke p4-edit, you'll lose your changes.  Instead:
;;    % p4 edit foo.c

;;; Installation

;; Features required by this library:
;;
;; `timer'

;; Features that may be required by this library if used with Xemacs or when
;; accessing select functionality:
;;
;; `dired', `easymenu', `ediff', `browse-url'

;; You should byte compile this file like this:
;;
;;    % emacs -batch -q -f batch-byte-compile /full/path/to/file/p4.el
;;
;; That creates a binary file /full/path/to/file/p4.elc.  Now add
;; /full/path/to/file to your load-path variable in your .emacs file.  Here's
;; one way to do it:
;;
;;    (setq load-path (cons "/full/path/to/file" load-path))
;;
;; Here's another way (inside a top-level progn special form, for example):
;;
;;    (push "/full/path/to/file" load-path)
;;
;; Finally, load the library in your .emacs like this:
;;
;;    (require 'p4)

;; If you have any problems to report, or suggestions, please send them
;; to p4el-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net or use M-x p4-bug-report (C-x p b).

  "Look for lines in BUFFER matching patterns described in DATA and call back.
For each line in BUFFER, or a subset thereof, look for regular expressions in
DATA that match.  For each match, invoke the callback.  If the callback returns
non-nil, process no more regular expressions in DATA for the current line.
Otherwise, repeat with the next regular expression in DATA.

The callback can use `match-beginning', `match-end', etc. as with `looking-at'
to understand the matching line.

BUFFER as for `p4-get-buffer'.
DATA has the form of a list in which each element describes a regular
   expression to match, a function to call when a match is found, and arguments
   to pass to that function.  The elements can have one of three forms: SYMBOL,
   (SYMBOL ARGS), or (RE (FUNCTION ARGS)).
START is the starting point in BUFFER for searching, if non-nil
END is the ending point in BUFFER for searching, if non-nil

The first form of DATA elements, SYMBOL, is a symbol with a value that is the
regular expression to match, and a function definition that is called with no
arguments.  (By using both the value and function definition of SYMBOL, the two
are tightly coupled preventing the chance of coupling the wrong function with a
regular expression.  It also avoids the need to invent related symbol names for
the two values.)

The second form, (SYMBOL ARGS), is like the first form, but supplies arguments
with which to invoke the function.

The third form, (RE (FUNCTION ARGS)), is the most general form in which RE is
the regular expression to match, FUNCTION is the function to call, and ARGS is
the arguments list to pass to it.

Note that in the second and third forms, when ARGS is a list, the callback
function is called using `apply'."
