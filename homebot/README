Homebot: An XMPP bot for fetching YouTube videos to my home server.

Given a regular old YouTube URL, for example (work-safe):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy6faAgrLg4

IM it homebot@tursom.org (XMPP/Jabber/GoogleTalk/whatever).  homebot
will fetch the video metadata, and IM that back to you.  It'll then
start downloading it in the highest video quality available and store it
to my AFS server.  Once it's done, homebot will IM you back saying the
transfer is complete.

So why go to all this trouble?  Well, we have these nice big screen TVs,
with Tivos that support 720p, so it's much nicer than watching stuff on
my husband's laptop.

Tivo does have a YouTube client, but there's no keyboard so the user
experience is poor.  Tivo's Home Media Option uses a fairly well
documented protocol, which has a python implementation called pyTivo
(http://pytivo.sourceforge.net/).  I use a very light-modified version
of pyTivo that to re-export videos out of AFS to the Tivo.

Homebot's code is in two parts -

garden/homebot/youtube_talk - the script that gets run as an init.d
  script
garden/gen/tursom.pm - yt_fetch_vid and other heavy lifting done there

youtube_talk spins up a master process that handles the connection to
XMPP.  Whenever it receives an IM, it forks off a child to handle the
HTTP fetches.  The child talks back to the master over a unix domain
socket, and uses that to send IMs back to the user.

Authorization: JIDs listed in the conf file (homebot.xml).
